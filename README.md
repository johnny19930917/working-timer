# working-timer
Simple working time count down tool. Just for practicing.

## Usage
1. Type in working time for today in hours
2. Just wait to clock out

## Note
* Use Sleep(1000) to simulate the timer for now.
* Time precision is not guaranteed.
* Plan to use time() to simulate the real world timer later.
